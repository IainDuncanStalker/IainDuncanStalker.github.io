<h2 id="currentProcess">Current Process Description</h2>
150 words + process map
<br>
You will choose an existing customer journey: describe and map it; specifically:
<ul>
<li>Identify the ideal outcome(s) of the customer journey. 
The customer exists to achieve a specific intended outcome or set of outcomes (the ideal outcome(s)); 
if all goes well, the customer achieves something at the end of this journey: for example, 
she might purchase a garment in the correct size and colour.  
The ideal outcome(s) happen(s) when the process runs without problems or exceptions.
</li>
<li>Identify everyone who benefits from the intended outcome of the customer journey.  The intended outcomes of the customer journey will be of benefit to the customer, but these may also benefit other interested parties: for example, when a customer purchases an item, the customer clearly benefits from obtaining the product, but the retailer benefits as it receives monies from a sale.
</li>
<li>Map and describe the customer journey.  Choose a starting point for the journey, e.g., the customer enters the store; and identify the stages of the customer journey from this starting point to all possible outcomes of the journey. When mapping the journey, you will also need to consider decision points and what happens if problems arise during the process.  For example, an in-store customer purchase may start when the customer enters a store with the ideal outcome being the purchase of a desired dress; other outcomes might include the customer leaves without purchasing because her size was not available; etc.
</li>
<li>Identify the resources and people involved the customer journey.  During each stage, the customer may perform certain actions, e.g. looking at dresses, the customer may interact with shop personnel, e.g., asking an assistant to check for her size, and may interact with other resources, e.g., visit a fitting room to try on the dress.  Identify who or what is involved in each stage of the customer journey. 
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="criteria">Criteria Important to the Customer Journey</h2>
(250 words)
You will identify the key Value Discipline of Treacy and Wiersema (1993 ) appropriate to your chosen organisation and use this to consider what is most important to the customer journey; this will allow you to identify a set of criteria that can be used to assess how well a particular instance of a customer journey meets the needs and expectations of the customer.  Examples might include
<ul>
<li>Customer Intimacy</li>
<ul>
<li>Personalisable process</li>
<li>Tailored offerings</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<li>Operational Excellence</li>
<ul>
<li>Easy process</li>
<li>Low cost</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<li>Product Leadership </li>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced customer service</li>
<li>Rich customer experience</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
You would explain precisely what is meant by each criterion and why each criterion supports the key value discipline.

In this section you will explain how digital technologies can be used to improve the customer journey and make specific recommendations.   You may find it easiest to do this in two subsections:

•	Digital Technologies/Interventions (100 words)
Describe the specific digital technologies that you recommened.
•	Revised/Improved Customer Journey (150 words + optional Revised Customer Journey Map)
Explain how and where (at what stages of the customer journey) the digital technologies will be used.

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
Using the criteria that you identified as important to the customer journey, you will evaluate the potential benefits and impact of your proposed recommendations.  

There will also likely be additional benefits to your recommendations that go beyond simply better meeting the criteria that you identified as important to the customer journey.

Finally, to ensure that you evaluation is balanced and critical, you will briefly discuss issues and challenges with your recommendations, e.g., cost implications, customer uptake, etc.
